# Netflix Clone with React

## Overview
A Netflix clone was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase and Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse and lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners.
